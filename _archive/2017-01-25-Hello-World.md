Now that I've got my first semester of Computer Systems at UL under my belt, I've decided to start writing a bit about my experiences as a CS student and to share some code that I'm working on.

I've decided to do this using GitHub pages, as A) it's a great opportunity to learn about using GitHub itself, B) I finally have to force myself to go learn Markdown, and C) it's free!
