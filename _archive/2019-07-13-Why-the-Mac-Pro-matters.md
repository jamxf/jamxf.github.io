title: Why the Mac Pro matters
---

In a previous life I worked in the media industry, composing, recording and mixing gigantic Pro Tools sessions, cutting 4k video, running all manner of control surfaces and external gear,  managing terabytes of data, and at the heart of all of this were two extremely capable, reliable and massive [cheese grater Mac Pros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Pro#1st_generation_(Tower)). They were a dream to use, handling even the most demanding projects. They also felt like home.

Stepping into a high end production studio for the first time is an intimidating experience, or at least it was for me. Being surrounded by racks upon racks of unfamiliar gear, set up in an unfamiliar way is daunting. Walking into a room like this, pausing to marvel at the vintage synths and outboard gear that you've only seen in the pages of [SoundOnSound](https://www.soundonsound.com) and trying to be productive is going to be a challenge. There's so much to learn, so much to figure out, all the while reamining focussed on the task at hand. You sit down in front of a mixing desk that seems to stretch on for miles in either direction, covered in buttons, knobs and sliders that you've never used before, surrounded by a pair of studio monitors that (each) probably cost more than your car.
