title: Semester Two Complete
---
Summer exams have just come to an end, and I'm sitting at home with a cup of tea after unpacking a seemingly endless amount of belongings from my car. My final exam, Computer Organisation 2, was on Saturday morning (9AM exams, who couldn't love that) went well, and on the two or so hours of a drive home from college, I had some time to think about the two semesters I've just completed.

 I think I've grown a lot, both as a programmer and as a person, and in an effort to keep the blog turning over during the summer months, I thought where better to start, than with a reflection on my freshman year as a mature student.

## System.out.print("I can code?");

The biggest difference between the James of 12 months ago and now, is that I can now with some degree of confidence call myself a programmer. Whilst the programs I can write are rudimentary, and I'm more than aware of the mountain of knowledge, and more importantly, understanding, that I still have ahead of me, programming no longer feels like some obscure, Pandora's box to me.

Across both semesters we had modules focussed on the fundamentals of Java, and in semester 2, our Computer Science module used Java to demonstrate some of the core concepts we were covering. Throw in a little LSL from our Virtual Worlds module, add a dash of assembly and finally season lightly with a simple hypothetical computer, complete with 4 digit OP-CODES, and you're well on your way to retraining your brain to think about things in the way a programmer should.

In fact, thinking about things, or more so, *changing* how I think about things, is something I've grown more and more aware of as the year moved on.
