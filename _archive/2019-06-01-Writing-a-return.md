title: Writing, a return
---

Inspired by a friend's [strikingly honest writing](https://my-cornertest.squarespace.com/blog/my-very-first-blog-post), and another friend's year long [attempt to improve his art](https://www.instagram.com/artworkbyandrew/), I have challenged myself to write and publish at least one post a week here for the rest of the year.

The first few things I've planned out include some strong opinions on the place of the 2019 Mac Pro in Apple's desktop line-up, thoughts on the difficulty of leading a team of your peers, as well as classic developer post discussing my experience with imposter syndrome.

I've always enjoyed the act of writing, but for whatever reason the habit of publishing has never stuck in the past. I hope that enforcing some form of structure and schedule will help improve both the quality, and quantity of updates here. Cheers for the inspo' Liam and Andrew.
